# rct-inforatio-analysis
## Overview
This repository contains R scripts for the pre-specified statistical analysis of the multicenter RCT evaluating the Inforatio technique as an adjunctive treatment for diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). R scripts are shared before data export from RedCap and therefore also before data analyses are executed to support transparency and document blinded, predefined analysis.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to:
1. Make the planned analysis fully transparent
2. Document that the statistical analysis was pre-specified and blinded
3. Allow other researchers to inspect and reuse the code

## About the R scripts
The R scripts are listed by numbers in the order that they are supposed to be run. It is especially important to run the to first scripts (1_ and 2_) before the rest of the scripts are run.
Anywhere in the scripts were 'Path_to_the_folder_in_the_working_directory' is written must be replaced with the path to the folder used within the working directory. The working directory has to be defined in script 2_ before the rest of the scripts are run.

## Published protocol
Protocol published in BMJ Open: https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/12/9/e062344. 
The Statistical analysis plan and the Handling of Missing Data section describe the predefined statistical analysis plan, which is followed in the R scripts uploaded in this Github project.

## ClinicalTrials.gov registration
Trial registered on ClinicalTrials.gov with ID: NCT05189470 prior to trial commencement.

## Open Science Dataframe (OSF) registration
The trial is registered on OSF, link: https://osf.io/bngya 
Blinded abstract will be uploaded to OSF on this project link after analyses are conducted but before unblinding the results
The R scripts included in this repository are also registered on OSF.  
To ensure transparency and reproducibility, the OSF version was **frozen on 10 December 2025**, meaning no further modifications or deletions are possible.  
This guarantees a permanent, citable record of the scripts exactly as they were used in the study.

## Data Availability
No data files are included in this repository. The full dataset from the randomized clinical trial may be provided upon reasonable request. Requests will be evaluated by the principal investigator (PI).
